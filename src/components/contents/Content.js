                  It is best to understand the various bikes for men before you
                  hit the shop button. Here's a little explanation about each
                  one:

                    <h4>Mountain Bikes for Men</h4>
                    <p>
                      Mountain biking involves cyclists riding bicycles off-road
                      (usually set on rough terrains like mountains, desert, or
                      rocks) on specially designed men's mountain bikes. These
                      bikes boast a stronger frame and often feature front and
                      rear suspensions which help in off-road performance. Some
                      of our bestselling mountain bikes involve the Wolverine
                      29T, the Samurai 26T & the Dragster 27.5T.

                    <h4>Electric Bicycle for Men</h4>
                    <p>
                      Whether your goal is to conquer miles on the road, tackle
                      steep and technical terrain off-road, or glide through
                      town without being drenched in sweat, your reasons to turn
                      to an electric bicycle may differ but what can't be
                      ignored is that E-bikes are quite a rage in today's world.
                      E-bicycles come with a battery-powered 'assist' that comes
                      via pedaling and, in some cases, a throttle. When you push
                      the pedals on a pedal-assist e-bike, a small motor engages
                      & gives you a boost, so you can ride uphill without tiring
                      yourself. The Meraki E-bike by Ninety One Cycles is
                      grabbing eyeballs for all the right reasons.

                    <h4>Hybrid Bikes for Men</h4>
                    <p>
                      Hybrid bikes combine the features of the road, mountain,
                      and touring bikes. Perfect for those on the fence who wish
                      to go for something comfortable and versatile, hybrid
                      bikes are great for multiple surfaces. They draw on the
                      strength of both mountain and touring bikes and merge this
                      with the sleek, aero nature of a road bike. Some of our
                      bestselling hybrid bikes are Endurance 700C, Wanderer 700C
                      & Wayfarer 700C.

                    <h4>Road Bikes for Men</h4>
                    <p>
                      Road bikes are built for speed. They are designed to
                      thrust you forward with every pedal stroke. They are very
                      light and have a lot more gears to adapt to any sort of
                      incline or decline. Everything about a road bike is
                      designed to push to the farthest distance with the most
                      efficiency. Have a look at our best road bikes: Revelator

                      What is the difference between a single-speed & geared
                      bicycle for men?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      To understand the difference between a men's geared cycle
                      and a single-speed cycle, it is important to understand
                      what both have to offer. A cycle with gears lets you
                      choose the gear ratio depending on the terrain you are
                      riding on. For instance, if you are riding on a slope, a
                      lower gear ratio lets you ride uphill easily by increasing
                      your pedaling rate while decreasing your effort. A
                      single-speed or non-geared cycle is a bicycle without any
                      gear and has a single gear ratio. The speed that you can
                      reach on such bikes depends completely on how fast or slow
                      you pedal. This particular reason limits the speed that
                      you can achieve on a single-speed cycle.
